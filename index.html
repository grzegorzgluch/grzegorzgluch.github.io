                                This paper presents a surprising connection between recent advances in delegation of quantum computation to adversarial robustness.
                                Imagine an adversary A that is in between a classifier C and a source S producing samples to be classified. Can we design an interactive protocol
                                 between C and the A, in which A would convince C that the samples being sent for classification really came from S? Using ideas from delegation
                                 of quantum computation we show it is possible to do it if A receives quantum states from S and A communicates with C classically. Why do we need
                                 quantum mechanics? Assume that S is uniform on {0,1}^n. How can A convince C that the samples he sent really came from S and were not handcrafted
                                 by S (if A received classical samples from S)? This seems to us be an almost impossible problem to solve, as we discuss in the paper.

                                <!-- <details><summary>Abstract</summary> Modern machine learning systems have been applied successfully to a variety of tasks in recent years but making such systems robust against adversarially chosen modifications of input
                                  instances seems to be a much harder problem. It is probably fair to say that no fully satisfying solution has been found up to date and it is not clear if the standard formulation even allows for a principled solution.
                                  Hence, rather than following the classical path of bounded perturbations, we consider a model similar to the quantum PAC-learning model introduced by Bshouty and Jackson [1995]. Our first key contribution shows that in
                                  this model we can reduce adversarial robustness to the conjunction of two classical learning theory problems, namely (Problem 1) the problem of finding generative models and (Problem 2) the problem of devising classifiers
                                  that are robust with respect to distributional shifts. Our second key contribution is that the considered framework does not rely on specific (and hence also somewhat arbitrary) threat models like l_p bounded perturbations.
                                  Instead, our reduction guarantees that in order to solve the adversarial robustness problem in our model it suffices to consider a single distance notion, i.e. the Hellinger distance. From the technical perspective our protocols
                                  are heavily based on the recent advances on delegation of quantum computation, e.g. Mahadev [2018].

                                  Although the considered model is quantum and therefore not immediately applicable to ``real-world'' situations, one might hope that in the future either one can find a way to embed ``real-world'' problems into a quantum framework
                                  or that classical algorithms can be found that are capable of mimicking their powerful quantum counterparts.</details> -->

                                The field of theroetical machine learning managed to produce some initial explanations for why neural networks perform so well in practice.
                                Unfortunately when reading these papers it is hard to see a common theme or a unifying message. In this paper we show how to look at many
                                of the recent advances through one lens, i.e. lens of symmetries. We show how this concept explains many previous results and how it helps to obtain new
                                ones. To do all of that we study a connection to the famous Noether's theorem from physics.</details>
                                <!-- <details><summary>Abstract</summary> Symmetries have proven to be important ingredients in the analysis of neural networks. So far their use has mostly been implicit or seemingly coincidental. We undertake a systematic study of the role that symmetry plays. In particular, we clarify how symmetry interacts with the learning algorithm. The key ingredient in our study is played by Noether's celebrated theorem which, informally speaking, states that symmetry leads to conserved quantities (e.g., conservation of energy or conservation of momentum). In the realm of neural networks under gradient descent, model symmetries imply restrictions on the gradient path. E.g., we show that symmetry of activation functions leads to boundedness of weight matrices, for the specific case of linear activations it leads to balance equations of consecutive layers, data augmentation leads to gradient paths that have "momentum"-type restrictions, and time symmetry leads to a version of the Neural Tangent Kernel. Symmetry alone does not specify the optimization path, but the more symmetries are contained in the model the more restrictions are imposed on the path. Since symmetry also implies over-parametrization, this in effect implies that some part of this over-parametrization is cancelled out by the existence of the conserved quantities. Symmetry can therefore be thought of as one further important tool in understanding the performance of neural networks under gradient descent. </details> -->

                                There are two sides of this paper. The technical one and potential applications to adversarial robustness. On the technical side we show  exponential separation
                                between two models. The standard PAC-learning model and the Equivalence-Query model in which the samples are acquired through an interaction between a teacher
                                and a learner, where the teacher provides counterexamples to hypotheses given by the learner. It is not surprising that one needs fewer samples in the Equivalence-Query
                                model but proving it formally is tricky and the reduction and the proof are quite involved. The second part, i.e. implications for adversarial robustness, was in fact
                                our motivation to study these two models. Our reasoning is as follows. Every adversarial attack in particular provides counterexamples to a given classifier and thus is
                                of the form of the EQ-model. Then the idea is that these adversarial examples can be used for learning faster. This is not a new idea- adversarial training does exactly
                                that. Our contribution is in PROVING that if the adversarial examples have particular structure then they can be used to improve learning over the standard approach.

                                <!-- <details><summary>Abstract</summary> We prove an exponential separation for the sample/query complexity between the standard PAC-learning model and a version of the Equivalence-Query-learning
                                  model. In the PAC model all samples are provided at the beginning of the learning process. In the Equivalence-Query model the samples are acquired through an interaction between a teacher
                                  and a learner, where the teacher provides counterexamples to hypotheses given by the learner. It is intuitive that in an interactive setting fewer samples are needed. We make this formal
                                  and prove that in order to achieve an error epsilon exponentially (in epsilon) fewer samples suffice than what the PAC bound requires. It was shown experimentally by Stutz, Hein, and Schiele
                                  that adversarial training with on-manifold adversarial examples aids generalization (compared to standard training). If we think of the adversarial examples as counterexamples to the current hypothesis
                                  then our result can be thought of as a theoretical confirmation of those findings. We also discuss how our result relates to adversarial robustness. In the standard adversarial model one restricts
                                  the adversary by introducing a norm constraint. An alternative was pioneered by Goldwasser et. al. Rather than restricting the adversary the learner is enhanced. We pursue a third path. We require
                                  the adversary to return samples according to the Equivalance-Query model and show that this leads to robustness. Even though our model has its limitations it provides a fresh point of view on adversarial robustness.</details> -->

                                <details><summary>Informal Abstract</summary> How hard is it to adversarially attack a network to which the adversary has black box access only?
                                That, of course, depends on what the adversary knows. If he knew the learning algorithm, training data and the randomness
                                used internally by the algorithm then the model becomes white-box from his point of view. In this paper we analyze what happens
                                if the adversary doesn't know the traning data nor the internal randomness. We show that the number of queries needed ro reliably attack
                                depends on the amount of "entropy" in the decision boundaries. Moreover we prove that some learning algorithms are inherently more secure, e.g. KNN, than
                                others, e.g. linear classifiers.</details>
                                <!-- <details><summary>Abstract</summary> There are two main attack models considered in the adversarial robustness literature: black-box and white-box. We consider these threat models as two ends of a
                                  fine-grained spectrum, indexed by the number of queries the adversary can ask. Using this point of view we investigate how many queries the adversary needs to make to design an attack that is
                                  comparable to the best possible attack in the white-box model. We give a lower bound on that number of queries in terms of entropy of decision boundaries of the classifier. Using this result
                                  we analyze two classical learning algorithms on two synthetic tasks for which we prove meaningful security guarantees. The obtained bounds suggest that some learning algorithms are inherently
                                  more robust against query-bounded adversaries than others.</details> -->

                                <details><summary>Abstract</summary> Given a graph G that can be partitioned into k disjoint expanders with outer conductance upper bounded by ∊ « 1, can we efficiently construct a small space data structure
                                  that allows quickly classifying vertices of G according to the expander (cluster) they belong to? Formally, we would like an efficient local computation algorithm that misclassifies at most an O(epsilon)
                                  fraction of vertices in every expander. We refer to such a data structure as a spectral clustering oracle.

                                  Our main result is a spectral clustering oracle with query time O^*(n^(1/2+O(epsilon))) and preprocessing time 2^O(1/epsilon k^4 log^2(k))n^(1/2 + O(epsilon)) that provides misclassification error O(epsilon log k) per cluster for any epsilon « 1/log k.
                                  More generally, query time can be reduced at the expense of increasing the preprocessing time appropriately (as long as the product is about n^(1+O(epsilon)) – this in particular gives a nearly linear
                                  time spectral clustering primitive.

                                  The main technical contribution is a sublinear time oracle that provides dot product access to the spectral embedding of G by estimating distributions of short random walks from vertices in G.
                                  The distributions themselves provide a poor approximation to the spectral embedding, but we show that an appropriate linear transformation can be used to achieve high precision dot product access.
                                  We give an estimator for this linear transformation and analyze it using spectral perturbation bounds and a novel upper bound on the leverage scores of the spectral embedding matrix of a k-clusterable graph.
                                  We then show that dot product access to the spectral embedding is sufficient to design a clustering oracle. At a high level our approach amounts to hyperplane partitioning in the spectral embedding of G,
                                  but crucially operates on a nested sequence of carefully defined subspaces in the spectral embedding to achieve per cluster recovery guarantees.</details>

                                  of the input. Given black-box access to a high-accuracy classifier f, we show how to construct a new classifier g that has high accuracy and is also robust to adversarial
                                  L2-bounded perturbations. Our algorithm builds upon the framework of randomized smoothing that has been recently shown to outperform all previous defenses against L2-bounded adversaries.
                                  Using techniques like random partitions and doubling dimension, we are able to bound the adversarial error of g in terms of the optimum error. In this paper we focus on our conceptual contribution,
                                  but we do present two examples to illustrate our framework. We will argue that, under some assumptions, our bounds are optimal for these cases.</details>

                    <p>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skier and novice ice climber. During the warmer months here in Colorado, I enjoy mountain biking, free climbing, and kayaking.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end web development world.</p>
